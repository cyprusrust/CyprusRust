Last wednesday we had the pleasure to help and partecipate at the first [AI Hack Lab](https://lu.ma/c1fuw0u0). The event was organised by our friends at [AIFoundry](https://aifoundry.org/) and it happened in Limassol at the [BrainRocket](https://www.brainrocket.com/) offices.

I gave a lighting talk discussing my experience of using Rust to do Generative AI - and it definitely sparked some interesting conversations!

It was great to connect with so many talented ML Engineers and to discuss where the Transformers architecture is moving forward and what's going to happen to the industry.

You can find the slides [here](https://cyprusrust.github.io/ai-rust-burn-slides/presenter) (with a brief description so you won't miss anything!)

You can also watch the talk here:
