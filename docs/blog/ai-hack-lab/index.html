<h3>AI in Rust and the Burn framework!</h3>
<h4>20th July 2024, Paphos</h4>
</hgroup>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Last wednesday we had the pleasure to help and partecipate at the first <a href="https://lu.ma/c1fuw0u0">AI Hack Lab</a>. The event was organised by our friends at <a href="https://aifoundry.org/">AIFoundry</a> and it happened in Limassol at the <a href="https://www.brainrocket.com/">BrainRocket</a> offices.</p>
<p>I gave a lighting talk discussing my experience of using Rust to do Generative AI - and it definitely sparked some interesting conversations!</p>
<p>It was great to connect with so many talented ML Engineers and to discuss where the Transformers architecture is moving forward and what's going to happen to the industry.</p>
<p>You can find the slides <a href="https://cyprusrust.github.io/ai-rust-burn-slides/presenter">here</a> (with a brief description so you won't miss anything!)</p>
<p>You can also watch the talk here:
