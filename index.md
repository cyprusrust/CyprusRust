Welcome to the Cyprus Rust user group! 
We are a community of Rust users in Cyprus who are passioned about sharing our knowledge
and experiences with the language. 

Our goal is to provide a space for Rust enthusiasts to come together, 
discuss the language, and learn from each other.

### Community

We have a friendly [Discord](https://discord.gg/3xKSyZM4mB) community where members can participate in online discussions, 
organised as part of the wider [Cyprus Developers Community](https://cdc.cy). 
This is a great way to stay connected with the community and continue learning and sharing 
even when we can't meet in person. 
See you online!

### Events

We're planning to occasionally host meetups to meet your fellow rustaceans face to face.
If you have something to share, you can [propose an event](https://github.com/cyprusrust/CyprusRust/issues/new/choose) on GitHub.

### Who is this for

Whether you are new to Rust or have been using the language for some time, 
we welcome you to join our community. 
We believe that by working together, we can all improve our skills 
and advance our knowledge of the language.

We hope to see you at one of our upcoming meetups!

### Code of Conduct
Our goal is to create a welcoming and inclusive community where members can
meet, socialize, exchange ideas, and learn from each other. 
We do not tolerate any harmful or discriminatory behavior, and anyone 
engaging in such behavior will be asked to leave the meetup.
