<h3>We talked Rust at the first CDCx ever!</h3>
<h4>23th January 2023, Paphos</h4>
</hgroup>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Last weekend we had the pleasure to give <a href="https://cyprusrust.github.io/rust-backend-slides/presenter/1">a talk</a> about our experience writing Backend Services in Rust at the first <a href="https://cdc.cy">CDCx</a> conference, hosted in Paphos.</p>
<p>We were joined by <a href="https://cyprusjs.org/">CyprusJS</a> who delivered a brilliant talk on <a href="https://solidjs.com/">Solid.js</a>.</p>
<p>It was great to meet all of you in person!</p>
<p>We've been playing with <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/">Axum</a> and <a href="https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx">sqlx</a> for a few versions now and we're very pleased with the workflow and with how fast and safely we're able to iterate.</p>
<p>Our services proved to be stable, use little memory and let us sleep peacefully at night, knowing that silly mistakes are kept at bay by Rust's compile-time checks.</p>
<p>If you want to have a look at a simple production application, we decided to open source <a href="https://github.com/apiplant/anonpaste-backend">one of our services</a>. Feedbacks, contributions and discussions are highly appreciated!</p>
<p>I think that Rust web ecosystem is mature enough to allow you to build productive applications.</p>
<p>Why not give it a go next time you start a new project?</p>
<p>If you need support feel free to come and drop a message on our <a href="https://discord.gg/3xKSyZM4mB">Discord</a>!</p>
