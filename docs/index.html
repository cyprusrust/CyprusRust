Welcome to the Cyprus Rust user group! 
We are a community of Rust users in Cyprus who are passioned about sharing our knowledge
and experiences with the language. 
<p>Our goal is to provide a space for Rust enthusiasts to come together, 
discuss the language, and learn from each other.</p>
<h3>Community</h3>
<p>We have a friendly <a href="https://discord.gg/3xKSyZM4mB">Discord</a> community where members can participate in online discussions, 
organised as part of the wider <a href="https://cdc.cy">Cyprus Developers Community</a>. 
This is a great way to stay connected with the community and continue learning and sharing 
even when we can't meet in person. 
See you online!</p>
<h3>Events</h3>
<p>We're planning to occasionally host meetups to meet your fellow rustaceans face to face.
If you have something to share, you can <a href="https://github.com/cyprusrust/CyprusRust/issues/new/choose">propose an event</a> on GitHub.</p>
