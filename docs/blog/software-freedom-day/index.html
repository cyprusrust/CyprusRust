<h3>Generative AI in Rust at Software Freedom Day!</h3>
<h4>1st October 2023, Paphos</h4>
</hgroup>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Last weekend your favourite people at the <a href="https://cdc.cy">CDC</a> organised a conference for <a href="https://wiki.softwarefreedomday.org/2023/Cyprus/Paphos/CDC">Software Freedom Day</a>. We beat all our affluence records and we had 3 great talks discussing Open Source.</p>
<p>Of course, I came up with a creative idea to include Rust in the discussion and prepared <a href="https://cyprusrust.github.io/generative-ai-slides">a talk</a> about my experience using AI and trying to avoid Python.</p>
<p>Even though the ecosystem is still in its early days, you can use <a href="https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs">tch-rs</a> to access torchlib (the very same library which powers Pytorch) and implement plenty of popular models (with a bit of effort).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/huggingface/candle">Candle</a> is definitely the project to keep an eye on; it's an machine learning framework written in Rust which wants to be minimal and ready for serverless.</p>
<p>It's also growing at a rapid pace: since my presentation, it already gained a <code>candle-transformers</code> crate which wants to mirror the popular Python package <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers">transformers</a>.</p>
<p>We also talked about fake OSS licenses like <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/open_rail">HuggingFace's OpenRAIL</a>, we worried about <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act">European regulations</a> destroying Open Source software and we discussed the pro and cons of having a personal Open Source project. What a day!</p>
<p>I was blown away by the quality of the talks.
